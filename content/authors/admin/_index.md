I am a fourth year PhD Student in the Computer Science Department at Johns Hopkins University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Jeremias Sulam. My research interests revolve around theoretical questions in machine learning and robustness gaurantees. I am also interested in exploiting structure in data to develop efficient algorithms (eg. sparsity, low rank).

Prior to starting my graduate studies, I was a research assistant at ORIE Department at Cornell where I was fortunate to be supervised by Professor Madeleine Udell. My work at Cornell involved developing low-memory algorithms for PDE-optimization (in collaboration with Dr. Drew Kouri of Sandia National Laboratories).
